            Hi! My name is Jessica (Zemble) Feinmesser. After making Aliyah in
            September 2021, I am proud to call myself a Jerusalem Based Artist.
            I have been scribbling on walls, drawing, and painting since I could
            first hold a crayon. At first, art was simply a hobby. After time
            and practice, however, it developed into a skill, and finally it
            transformed into a passion. For me, art is not just a way to spend
            time. Rather, it is a way to portray ideas and feelings that often
            cannot be put into words. Each stroke and splatter tells a story of
            its own. I attended art lessons for many years before progressing to
            independent work. After much commitment to my personal development,
            I began teaching lessons of my own to budding young artists. My
            artwork can be found in homes, institutions, and publications
            throughout Israel and America. The Jerusalem Canvas began when a
            friend asked if I could sell prints of my artwork- she wanted to
            gift them to her future husband as a wedding present. Me? Sell my
            paintings? Who was I to be able to do that? Despite my insecurities
            I said yes, and haven't looked back since. With immense gratitude to
            Hashem, the response has been incredible, and it is an honor to have
            my artwork displayed on the walls, frames, and benchers of happy
            clients across the globe.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have combined my background in computer science and art in order
            to develop The Jerusalem Canvas's website. Here you will find
            paintings from different stages and perspectives in my life. Each
            tells a story, and each will relate to its viewer in a unique way.
            In addition to the paintings and prints available in the gallery, I
            offer the special service of working directly with customers to
            create custom paintings, portraits, and logos. I am more than happy
            to be in touch with you regarding any questions or comments that you
            might have. Check out our “Contact Us” page for more information,
